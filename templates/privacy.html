                                        together with the App, &nbsp; the “Package”) provided under separate license terms (the “Third Party Terms”), as described in more detail at the bottom of this EULA. Your use of the Third Party Software in
                                        &nbsp; conjunction with the App in a manner consistent with the terms of this EULA is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable Third Party Terms and nothing &nbsp; in this EULA is

                                        as described in Section 22.b,
                                        you and BCM agree &nbsp; that every dispute arising in connection with this EULA will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
                                        arbitrator &nbsp; instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief &nbsp;
                                        that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, &nbsp;
                                        misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY &nbsp; ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND
                                        BCM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>

                                        the right of either party to:
                                        (i) bring an individual action &nbsp; in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief
                                        in a court of law in &nbsp; aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</span></p>

                                        American Arbitration Association
                                        (“AAA”) under its &nbsp; Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by this EULA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at &nbsp;
                                        1-800-778-7879, or by contacting BCM. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding &nbsp; arbitration
                                        agreement.</span></p>
                                    <p id="u94-374" style="font-family: PT Serif;"><span class="texto" id="u94-373">&nbsp;74. Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
                                        other party by certified U.S.
                                        Mail or by Federal Express &nbsp; (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). BCM’s address for Notice is:
                                        Baggage &nbsp; Claim Matching, LLC., 1150 S. Yale St. #2, Santa Monica California 90403. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth &nbsp;
                                        the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after &nbsp; the Notice of
                                        Arbitration is received, you or BCM may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise &nbsp; agreed by the parties in writing. During
                                        the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or BCM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes &nbsp; a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator
                                        awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by BCM in settlement of the dispute prior to the &nbsp; award, BCM will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the
                                        arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.</span></p>
                                    <p id="u94-376" style="font-family: PT Serif;"><span class="texto" id="u94-375">&nbsp;75. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, BCM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,
                                        unless your claim is for more than
                                        $10,000, in which case &nbsp; the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California, but if the
                                        claim &nbsp; is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based &nbsp;
                                        telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance &nbsp; of your claim or
                                        the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), &nbsp; then the payment of all fees will be
                                        governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse BCM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation &nbsp; to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in
                                        which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any,
                                        are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or &nbsp; expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within
                                        14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits</span></p>

                                        AS A PLAINTIFF OR &nbsp;
                                        CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BCM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than &nbsp; one person’s claims, and may not
                                        otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></p>

                                        to BCM’s address for Notice of
                                        Arbitration, you may &nbsp; reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to BCM’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with BCM will be immediately
                                        &nbsp; terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</span></p>

                                        Section 22 will be null and void &nbsp; and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24 will govern any action arising out of or related to this

                                        to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this EULA, or any provision of this EULA, be a waiver of any &nbsp; subsequent breach or default or a
